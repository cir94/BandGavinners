  <p>Taking the place of the second guitarist of The Gavinners, Daryan <br>Crescend also works within law enforcement as an International<br> agent within the Criminal Affairs Department. Although he has<br> a hard-headed demeanor and is a cocky fellow, he remains<br> as one of the famous members of the Gavinners, and gets<br> along very well with his cohorts and bandmates.</p>
